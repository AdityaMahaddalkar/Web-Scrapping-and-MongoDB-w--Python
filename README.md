# Web Scrapping and MongoDB w/ Python

Simple code to demonstrate web scrapping and working with database in Python.

You can use this code to create your own dataset for different cities by changing the URL in
scrapper.py file.

Note: DONOT issue multiple requests in very small time to any web-page. This is called spamming.
      A count of one request in 5-10 minutes is ok. DONOT exceed this limit.
